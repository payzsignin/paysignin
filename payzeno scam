In addition, technological innovation has enabled automated underwriting and loan origination, with applications processed via mobile or online banking and the proceeds deposited into customersâ€™ accounts the same day. That saves banks money and time, and can help consumers borrow more quickly from banks than they can from payday lenders. These small installment loans could be made without borrowers leaving home or disclosing information to a third party, such as a payday lender, which improves their safety. If these loans were to become widely available, millions of borrowers now using payday and other high-cost loans could save billions of dollars annually.
