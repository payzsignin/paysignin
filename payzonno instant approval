These loans feature terms that are largely in line with The Pew Charitable Trusts’ published standards for safe and affordable small-dollar loans. The three-month loans are repaid in equal installments and feature payments that don’t exceed 5 percent of a borrower’s monthly income. They cost $12 for every $100 borrowed, which translates to an effective annual rate of 71 percent— about six times lower than typical payday loan rates. For example, a $400, three-month loan from U.S. Bank costs $48, compared with about $350 from a payday lender.

When Pew surveyed payday loan customers about numerous possible reforms, the most popular was enabling banks and credit unions to offer small loans at significantly lower prices than those charged by payday lenders. Research by Pew—and U.S. Bank’s actions—demonstrate that banks and credit unions have such a large comparative advantage that they can offer loans at prices that are six to eight times lower than payday lenders and still make a profit. The annual percentage rates have to be higher than those on credit cards, of course, but neither the public nor the payday loan borrowers Pew surveyed see that as unfair as long as APRs do not exceed double digits. Effective annual percentage rates for payday, pawn, auto title or rent-to-own loans can top 300 percent.
