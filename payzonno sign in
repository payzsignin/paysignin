The nation’s three federal bank regulators—the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—are working together to find ways to improve access to small-dollar loans, raising hopes that more banks could offer affordable small installment loans that cost about six times less than payday loans.

To date, most banks have not offered small installment loans in part because of concerns that without explicit approval, they could be subject to future regulatory action. An announced agreement on rules for such lending could substantially boost the market for affordable alternatives to payday and similar high-cost loans.  Twelve million American adults use payday loans annually. Average borrowers earn about $30,000 per year, and most use costly payday loans to cover ordinary living expenses over the course of months, not unexpected emergencies over the course of weeks. Bank regulators are examining ways to make less burdensome alternatives more widely available.
